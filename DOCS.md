# Developer Docs

## Architecture

The package has four main subsystems:

- CLI commands in `src/cli`
- Install and audit logic in `src/install`
- GitHub research and repo analysis in `src/research`
- Static installable assets in `templates`, `agents`, `skills`, `prompts`, `checklists`, and `design-adapters`

The CLI reads bundled assets from the package root so the same commands work in local development and after build.

## Install Behavior

`agent-kit init --stack next-supabase` installs root markdown docs and copies library assets into `.agent-kit/`.

Existing files are never overwritten by default. Conflicting template updates are written to `.agent-kit/conflicts/`.

## Research Behavior

`research discover` requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and writes `research/repo-candidates.json`.

`research scan` shallow clones each candidate, runs static analysis, writes a per-repo markdown finding, and removes clones unless `--keep-clones` is used.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- doctor
npm test
npm run build
```

## CI

GitHub Actions runs on pushes and pull requests to `main`.

Required gates:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- `npm pack --dry-run`

## Delivery Tracking

Use `ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth for phased implementation status and next actions.

## Release Notes

This is a private package. Before external release, replace the private license, remove internal assumptions, and review all prompts for proprietary content.
